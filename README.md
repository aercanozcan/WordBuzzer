# WordBuzzer
A small word game.

### How much time invested
* total 5(approximetely) hours I exceed the time limit by 1 hour
* 1.5 hours for deciding the  animations, transitions, icons, sounds and game mechanics by drawing on papers 
or listening sound effects on internet
* half an hour for deciding my approach to code design.
* 3 hours of implementation

### Decisions made to solve certain aspects of the game
* I used same animation code to make a good enough intro screen. That bought me some time.
* I used Application class to hold referenc to word.json

### Decisions made because of restriced time

* I made an expanding animation instead of making a proper dialog screen.
* I did not use any database
* I was planing to make the game playeble for both languages but I ended up making it english to spanish.
* I skipped the styling

### What would be the first thing to improve or add if there had been more time

* I would move json data to a proper database or orm.
* I would make a better styling for application
* Make the game to be playable for both languages or any other language combination since design is not messed up, it can be implemented.
* A better winning feedback to player.
* I wanted to play Guile Theme song from street fighter 2 when a player is 1 score away from winning the game.
